# Budget-Tracker-PWA (https://sd-budget-tracker-pwa.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
Budget Tracker is a progressive web application that allows the user to track their finances, 
with or without internet connection. My task with this project was to add functionality to a 
pre-built application to allow for offline access and functionality. This application achieves offline functionality by utilizing 
Service Workers and the Cache API to store static files and API responses in the users local cache. 
When the user is offline they have access to this data and these cached files. While offline, they may 
add an expense or deposit, which is stored in their local IndexedDB database. When internet connection is detected, 
those transactions are posted from their IndexedDB database to their MongoDB database. Their total budget is then updated, 
and their IndexedDB pending object store is cleared.
